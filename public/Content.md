## About Us

WHAT IS SCINNOVA?

Scinnova 2025: Igniting Young Minds through Transdisciplinary Exploration
Scinnova is Cedar College’s flagship science competition, designed to be more than just an academic challenge. It is an immersive learning experience that brings together 60 teams of budding scientists from across Karachi and Pakistan, with each team comprising 4-7 members aged 14-18. This year’s Scinnova consists of nine modules, each an intellectual arena representing a distinct field of science. Together, they showcase how a deep, interdisciplinary understanding of our world fosters true critical thinking, collaboration, and innovation.

With two competitive rounds in each module, students face three hours of intensive engagement per module, plus an hour dedicated to setup, briefing, scoring, and preparation. Scinnova is an arena for future problem-solvers, where hands-on challenges lead students to push beyond textbook knowledge, cultivating teamwork and critical reasoning.

## Modules

Arcanum
Arcanum introduces students to the intersection of science and mystery. Using forensic science, data encryption, and logic puzzles, teams tackle scenarios involving cryptographic challenges and crime scene analysis. This module develops analytical and deductive reasoning skills, teaching students the applications of mathematics, logic, and technology in solving real-world puzzles and uncovering hidden patterns.

Illuminatio
In Illuminatio, students engage in hands-on experiments, delving into the composition and transformation of matter. Teams conduct experiments that reveal chemical reactions, molecular structures, and energy dynamics. This module emphasizes safety protocols, attention to detail, and the scientific method.

Ptolemy's Puzzles
Named after the renowned mathematician Ptolemy, this module involves complex problem-solving, mathematical modeling, and logical puzzles. Students apply algebra, geometry, and calculus to solve theoretical and practical challenges.

Planck's Paradox
Planck’s Paradox brings theoretical physics to life by guiding students through paradoxes and scenarios where common sense meets scientific complexity. From exploring quantum mechanics to relativistic principles, students grapple with concepts that stretch their critical thinking.

Asclepius
Named after the Greek god of medicine, Asclepius offers students a journey into the life sciences. Through dissections, genetic analysis, and simulations of biological processes, participants experience the complexity of living organisms.

RedShift
Redshift immerses students in the mysteries of space, challenging them to explore concepts of astrophysics and cosmology. Teams use telescopic data, star maps, and astrophysical simulations to investigate celestial phenomena. The module nurtures observational skills and scientific reasoning, encouraging students to draw connections between abstract physics theories and tangible data from the universe, thus understanding our cosmic neighborhood in a holistic manner.

Automation
In the Robotics module, students dive into robotics, applying engineering principles, physics, and coding skills to design and program functional robots. Participants collaborate to solve specific tasks, fostering an understanding of mechanics, control systems, and problem-solving through real-time testing and modification. Students learn how mechanical systems and computer algorithms can harmonize, illustrating the interdisciplinary nature of engineering.

Freud's Foresit
This module encourages students to enter the fascinating field of psychology, focusing on human behavior and cognitive functions. Through experimental tasks, role-playing, and group scenarios, students study psychological theories and apply them to real-life settings. Freud’s Foresit reinforces the importance of understanding human interactions, fostering empathy, and exploring the human mind. This module reminds students that scientific inquiry extends beyond physical phenomena to include the intricacies of human nature.
